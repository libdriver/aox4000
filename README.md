## LibDriver AOX4000

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/aox4000/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

AOX4000 is an oxygen sensor based on the principle of fluorescence quenching, which measures the partial pressure of oxygen in the environment. The sensor is equipped with a built-in air pressure sensor, which can directly output the values of ambient air pressure, oxygen partial pressure, and oxygen concentration, making it easy for users to intuitively read the data. Compared with electrochemical sensors, AOX4000 uses non lossy oxygen sensitive materials, thus having a longer lifespan. Due to its temperature compensation function, no additional compensation system is required. AOX4000 is very stable and environmentally friendly, without lead or any other harmful substances, and is almost unaffected by cross interference from other gases.

LibDriver AOX4000 is a full-featured AOX4000 driver launched by LibDriver, which provides functions such as oxygen partial pressure reading, oxygen concentration reading, atmospheric pressure reading, temperature reading and so on. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Install

Reference /interface UART platform independent template and finish your platform UART driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_aox4000_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint32_t i;

res = aox4000_basic_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...
    
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    float oxygen_ppo2_mbar;
    float oxygen_density_percentage;
    float temperature_degree;
    float pressure_mbar;

    /* delay 1000ms */
    aox4000_interface_delay_ms(1000);

    /* read data */
    res = aox4000_basic_read(&oxygen_ppo2_mbar, &oxygen_density_percentage,
                            &temperature_degree, &pressure_mbar);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)aox4000_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }

    /* output */
    aox4000_interface_debug_print("aox4000: %d/%d.\n", i + 1, 3);
    aox4000_interface_debug_print("aox4000: oxygen ppo2 is %0.2fmbar.\n", oxygen_ppo2_mbar);
    aox4000_interface_debug_print("aox4000: oxygen density is %0.2f%%.\n", oxygen_density_percentage);
    aox4000_interface_debug_print("aox4000: temperature is %0.2fC.\n", temperature_degree);
    aox4000_interface_debug_print("aox4000: pressure is %0.2fmbar.\n", pressure_mbar);
    
    ...
}

...
    
/* deinit */
(void)aox4000_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```
